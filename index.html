    <div id="paragraph1">Hi, I'm Connor! I currently work as a video editor for two YouTube channels: False Swipe Gaming and Tempo Storm. I consider myself extremely lucky to be working for these two channels because I get to create videos about competitive video games (also known as esports). Competitive gaming has been one of my biggest passions in life. I began going to Super Smash Bros. tournaments when I was 12 years old and continue to attend tournaments at the age of 24!</div>

    <div id="paragraph2">In my free time, I love to hang out with friends and go out to eat with them (just like everyone else). I'm also currently interested in learning how to play the piano and how to speak Korean. Although I'm not Korean, I'm a huge fan of their culture and want to visit Seoul some day.</div>
